# Inquiring App
## Please see the included videos in case cors produces issues, this happened on my machine and unfortunately I couldn't make it work in time but I have made videos showing both front-end and back-end working 
Inquire app for one of the code challenges (Tasty Treats)


Please start the node js backend using "npm start" . Then start the frontend using the same command.
The front-end works without the backend in case cors issue appear but on request I can show it working without any issues.
